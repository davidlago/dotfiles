## Dotfiles
This is a collection of my personal configuration files. It installs git,
zsh, oh-my-zsh and tmux, and tweaks their config files.

### Installation
Clone repository directly in your home directory, and run the installer:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/davidlago/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
<log out and back in...>
./install.sh
```
