## Dotfiles
This is a collection of my personal configuration files. In order to install,
first you have to have [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) installed and set as your
default shell, the latest version of
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and the latest version
of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).

### Installation
Clone repository directly in your home directory, and run the installer:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/davidlago/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
