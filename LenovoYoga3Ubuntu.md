## Installing Ubuntu in a Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro
This is a brief document outlining the steps I am taking as I configure my new
Yoga Pro 3 to my liking. I'm assuming Ubuntu 16.04 has been successfully
installed, and that the ```setup.sh```  and ```install.sh``` scripts have been
run.

### Misc configuration tweaks
  * **Change terminal profile** colors to black background, light grey text,
  white bold text, transparent background and adjust the initial number of rows
  and columns.
